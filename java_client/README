To compile this one you need:

(Except the obvious jdk-1.6)

commons-cli-1.1.jar from http://commons.apache.org/cli/, version (surprize, surprize) 1.1.
swixml.jar from http://www.swixml.org/, version 1.6.
jdom.jar from http://www.jdom.org/, version 1.0, you can also use version supplied with swixml.

Just put those files in the same directory as all *.java files.

Good luck!
