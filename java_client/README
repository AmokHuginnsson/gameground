To compile this one you need:

(Except the obvious jdk-1.6)

commons-cli-1.1.jar:
  from: http://commons.apache.org/cli/
  version: (surprise, surprise) 1.1


swixml.jar:
  from: http://www.swixml.org/
  version: 1.6


jdom.jar:
  from: http://www.jdom.org/
  version: 1.0
  notes: you can also use version supplied with swixml


forms-1.1.0.jar:
  from: http://www.jgoodies.com/
  version (surprise, surprise) 1.1.0
  notes: version supplied with swixml will suffice


Just put those files into ./lib/ subdirectoy (create it first!) that is relative to the directory with *.java files.

Good luck!
